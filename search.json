It is also well known that coral reefs are dying at a rapid pace. But we have no direct measure of what coral limits are to low oxgyen under warming.\nWe are measuring the oxygen limits (Pcrit) of seven different coral species between 25 and 35C. We will use our results to determine if corals can actively regulate their oxygen consumption, and if so, to what point. We also will compare their oxygen limits to environmental oxygen levels measured from the reef habitats they live. This will indicate the role of environmental oxygen in coral reef survival.\nOur corals and physical data are taken from Punta Caracol in Bahia Almirante:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Punta Caracol, the project study site is located in Bahia Almirante, Bocas del Toro, Panama.
